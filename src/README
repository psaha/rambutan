How to install Spidery WEB:

1) Pick a directory to install the WEB source in. Call it WEBROOT.

2) untar the distribution in WEBROOT (cd WEBROOT; tar xvf spiderweb.tar)

3) change to the master subdirectory and edit WebMakefile.
	-- Set WEBROOT to the WEBROOT directory
	-- Set DEST to the name of a directory to hold the executables
	-- Set MACROS to the name of directory to hold TeX macros
   Example:
	WEBROOT=/usr/src/local/spiderweb
	DEST=/usr/local
	MACROS=/usr/lib/tex/macros

   Make sure there are no spaces following the names.

5) Check that your system has an `arch' program. If not, make one (a shell
   script is fine) and put it somewhere on your path.

6) Check that your system has `awk'.

7) Go into WEBROOT and type `make boot'

   Once this is successful you will have executable versions of tangle for
   C and Awk, which is the minumum needed to make other things.  After you've
   done this, you can afford to `make clean', which will remove the .c and
   .awk source you used to bootstrap yourself.  You can always make them over
   again using the executable versions (`make source').

   In case it isn't clear, once you `make boot' you will never need to do
   it again.

8) Go into the java directory and type `build'.
