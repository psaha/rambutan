The following instructions are for a makefile install. You don't need
system privileges.

If you are not on a GNU/Linux or other Unix-like system, you will need
to adapt the following.

1) In the makefile, change BIN and TEXINPUTS into sensible things for
   your system.

   For example, on my machines, I have
       BIN = $(HOME)/Local/bin/
       TEXINPUTS = $(HOME)/Local/tex/
   Accordingly, I have $HOME/Local/bin/ on my $path and also
       setenv TEXINPUTS \
       .:$HOME/Local/tex//:/usr/share/texmf/tex//:/usr/share/texmf/pdftex//:
   in my .cshrc file.

2) Type "make install" and then "make clean".

3) Type "rehash" to tell the system there are new executables.

4) Test by typing "javatangle Manual Manual".  This should produce the
   file Primes.java, which you can compile with "javac Primes.java"
   and then run with "appletviewer primes.html".

5) For the manual, type "javaweave Manual Manual" to get
   Manual.tex, which you can pdftex or tex.  This document is both
   example and manual, and there is no separate man page.


The src/ directory contains the files necessary to make rambutan using
Normal Ramsay's spiderweb system.  Spiderweb itself is in
/ctan/web/spiderweb/src/ in CTAN.
